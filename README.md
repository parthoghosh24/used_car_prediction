![Kurt](images/kurt.jpeg)

Predict the prices of used cars to help car dealers sell and market better. This is the solution
for practical assignment 11.1 (BHPCMLAI)

### Summary of findings

We have applied CRISP-DM to come up with a working model for the problem. The findings are as follows:

![prediction_vs_actual](images/actual_predicted_regplot.png)

- We could predict price of car with r2 score of 0.35 using Linear Regression.
- The top features which guides the price are year of the model, transmission type and car type.
